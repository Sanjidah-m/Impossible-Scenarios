# Impossible-Scenarios

An n Ã— n Wumpus world (Fig 7.2) with no wumpus contains gold at a
random location which may be the start location (bottom-left corner)
itself. There are m randomly located pits. The pits can not be at start
or gold locations. Write a function impossibleScenarios(n, m) that
counts the number of scenarios where no path from start cell to the
gold cell exists.
